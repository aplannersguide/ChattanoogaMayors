He founded Smith's Crossroads (Dayton) after purchasing 60 acres there in 1820.Dr. Milo Smith studied medicine at the Philadelphia Medical School in Pennsylvania.  He had “a great deal of information on almost every subject pertaining to matters Biblical and historical, but especially physic”.Milo Smith had come down river from Rhea County to the new Ross's Landing settlement where his sister, Eliza, had moved with her husband, John P. Long. From the commissioners who had laid out and were selling off Chattanooga lots, he purchased lot 38 on Poplar Street for $220 in 1840.He sold this lot and built on lot 42 nearby. At the time of the Indian removal, both Dr. Smith and his father worked with the government.  William Smith relocated to Rawlingsville, Ala., in this capacity.

Macmurphy's sister was the wife of another Chattanooga mayor, Charles Grenville.Dr. Smith was one of the founders of the Presbyterian Church at Chattanooga.  He was also the leading medical practice, but he seemed almost unconcerned about whether or not he was paid.  It was said by old citizens, that Mayor Dr. Milo Smith waited upon the entire city of Chattanooga without charge and that, in a sense established the first free clinic in the city.  It is told that he never sent a bill to anyone.  His clients paid when they pleased, if at all.He seems to have been, without exception, the most popular citizen in Chattanooga’s early life and Dr. Smith was so well liked by the community that several babies were named in his honor.Dr. Milo Smith served his first term as Mayor in 1842 and was re-elected in 1843, making him the first mayor to serve two terms.The Milo Smiths remained in Chattanooga throughout much of the war between the States at their brick home on Cameron Hill on the east side of Poplar Street between Fifth and Sixth streets.  Dr. Smith served as mayor again in 1862 and 1863, until his office was abrogated by Military Occupation.He treated many wounded soldiers from both armies in the war-torn city.  Caroline Smith took care of a baby who had lost its mother when only six weeks old and whose father was one of the artillerymen under the duty of firing shells into Chattanooga. Dr. Smith early in 1864 “felt it necessary to leave Chattanooga.” His home on Poplar Street was sold to John G. Glass.

Unlike the other, Hugh Whiteside, Bass’s family was not a family of great wealth.  Orphaned at the age of eleven, Bass left school to begin work along the production line at the D.M. Stewart Manufacturing Plant.  By 1900, Bass had saved enough money to follow in his father’s footsteps and open a grocery on the corner of Main Street and Central Avenue.In 1906, as a group of businessmen formed the Highland Park Business League and searched for a candidate to run for the Hamilton County Court; Bass agreed to be a candidate.  Upon winning the seat, Bass sold his grocery store and dedicated his life to public service.  In 1911, as Mayor T.C. Thompson led the campaign to change the city government to the commission format, Bass ran for the state senate.  As a Senator, Bass helped pass the legislature that allowed Chattanooga to change its city government structure.  After his senate term, Bass returned to Chattanooga and served as Commissioner of Streets and Sewers for three terms.  During his service as a commissioner, Bass attended the University of Chattanooga’s Law School and passed the bar at the age of forty-six. Upon the resignation of Mayor Chambliss in 1923, Bass’s fellow Commissioners elected him mayor.  However, state politics kept Bass from accepting the position.  In 1923, as Governor Austin Peay prepared to appoint Mayor Chambliss to the Tennessee Supreme Court, he was pressured to not appoint Chambliss if it meant that Bass would become mayor in Chattanooga.  Governor Peay then asked Bass to promise that, if elected, he would not serve.  Bass did as the Governor asked.  The motivation for this political action appears to have been pressure from the statewide Ku Klux Klan, who promised to have Chambliss’ appointment blocked if Bass was to step up to the position of mayor in Chattanooga.During his last term as Commissioner of Streets and Sewers, Bass performed an act that may be the one he is most remembered for; he extended Broad Street past Ninth Street (today, Martin Luther King Boulevard.)  At the time, Broad Street ended at Ninth Street where a row of brick buildings sat upon the southern side of Ninth Street across from Broad Street.  The warehouses, owned by the state of Georgia, sat empty, and Bass worked for many years to negotiate the purchase of the buildings so that Broad Street could be opened to the south.  Georgia officials continually refused to sell the buildings.  On May 6, 1926, a Friday night, without consulting the Mayor, city attorney or other commissioners, Commissioner Bass led a large crew of street department workers in descending upon the buildings and tore them down.  Beginning this mission around 6:00 pm, Bass drove the first car through the opened buildings around midnight.  According to news accounts, word of the escapade spread quickly, and the streets filled with citizens cheering Bass and his workmen.  The Elks Club Band, said to be practicing nearby, appeared and played the song “Marching through Georgia.”  By Monday morning, the length of Broad Street was extended.  The state of Georgia sought immediate action against the city, but the Supreme Court ruled that a state’s sovereignty ended at the state line.  The following Saturday, Commissioner Bass and his crew began the destruction of buildings that blocked Broad Street at Eleventh.  At the end of his project, Commissioner Bass had successfully opened Broad Street south to link with Whiteside Street (which ran from Lookout Mountain to Twelfth Street.)  Today, Whiteside Street is known as South Broad Street.In 1927, the city of Chattanooga elected Bass as mayor and re-elected him for the next five terms.  Mayor Bass led the city through many events, including the nation’s Great Depression.  Upon his retirement in 1947, Bass said he took great pride in the fact that, during the Depression, Chattanooga was one of the few cities able to meet its debts without issuing city script.  At the time, Bass noted that not only did Chattanooga pay all its debt but continued to pay all of its city employees without raising the tax rate.In 1929, Mayor Bass oversaw the annexation of many of Chattanooga’s suburbs including St. Elmo, Missionary Ridge, Alton Park, North Chattanooga, Brainerd and Riverview.  These annexations doubled the size of Chattanooga.   In a press conference on June 17, 1946, Bass announced that he would not seek re-election the following year but would complete his term even though his doctors had asked him to resign from office due to health problems.  On January 10, 1947, three months before his term ended, Bass’s health forced him to resign. 							 	         _                            Close"

He worked with leaders in our community to improve and increase air service and he’s established partnerships to take advantage of Chattanooga’s location in the Technology Corridor and help shape a new economy for our citizens.Perhaps the most visible accomplishments of his administration have been his transformative work on the waterfront and in education.Early on, Mayor Corker responded to the notice that nine of our urban elementary schools were in trouble and marked by the State as problem facilities. He gathered community leaders and worked hand in hand with the county to establish the Community Education Alliance which provided incentives for teachers and principals at these nine schools. The premise of the Alliance was that every child could learn and that teaching was among the most noble of all professions. After three years, 56 of the school system’s most effective educators are taking advantage of the bonus incentives for high performing teachers and principals. Since the effort began, these schools have outpaced all other schools in the system in student gains and in the fall of 2003 they opened for the first time with not a single position vacant. These schools have become places where educators want to be. These educators and this effort have shown that if public education is supported appropriately, tremendous results can be achieved.In 2002 the Mayor announced a plan to completely reshape the face of our city through the 21st Century Waterfront Plan. He asked the community for their input and what resulted was a plan that would change the look and feel of our community forever. Mayor Corker worked to establish a $120 million trust to fund the endeavor which came from revenue by taxes paid by visitors and from local donations. This entire effort was completed in a way that leaves absolutely no financial burden on the citizens of Chattanooga.Today the 21st Century Waterfront Plan is being implemented and defining our community in the eyes of others. Other initiatives like the Public Art Plan and the Outdoor Initiative have grown from this original blueprint for change. Through his determination and with the help of so many in our community, the Mayor has led a revitalization that spans the economic, aesthetic, and educational lines. He has brought people from all walks of life together with a common goal of improving their community and the results have been outstanding.Mayor Corker’s leadership and enthusiasm for Chattanooga has helped make our community the model of the 21st Century American City. 							 	         _                            Close"
